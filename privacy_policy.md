## 3. How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect to:

- Provide and operate the app (EV charging station finder, classifieds, motors, services, rentals, reviews, and related features).
- Create and manage your account and authenticate you (e.g. login, secure token storage).
- Show nearby charging stations and enable map and navigation features.
- Publish, display, and manage your ads and listings and allow other users to contact you (e.g. via phone) as you choose.
- Improve the app, fix errors, and develop new features.
- Send you important updates (e.g. app or policy changes) and, where you have agreed, marketing or promotional communications.
- Protect our users and services (e.g. fraud prevention, security monitoring, enforcing our terms).
- Comply with applicable laws and respond to lawful requests from authorities.

We do not use your data for purposes incompatible with these without your consent or as required by law.

## 4. Information Sharing and Disclosure

We do not sell your personal data. We may share your information only in the following cases:

- **With your consent:** when you explicitly agree to share data (e.g. when your contact details are shown on your ads to other users).
- **Service providers:** with trusted partners who help us run the app (e.g. hosting, analytics, maps) under strict confidentiality and data protection obligations.
- **Legal and safety:** when required by law, court order, or government request, or when necessary to protect the rights, safety, or property of EmiratesEV, our users, or the public.
- **Business transfers:** in the event of a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, your data may be transferred as part of that transaction, subject to the same privacy commitments.

We do not share your personal data with third parties for their own marketing unless you have given clear consent.

## 5. Data Security

We take the security of your data seriously. We use industry-standard measures to protect your information, including:

- **Encryption:** data in transit is protected using SSL/TLS. Sensitive data such as authentication tokens are stored using secure, encrypted storage on your device (e.g. secure storage / keychain).
- **Access controls:** access to personal data is limited to personnel who need it for the purposes described in this policy.
- **Monitoring:** we monitor for unauthorized access and take steps to prevent and respond to security incidents.

While we strive to protect your data, no system can be 100% secure. You are responsible for keeping your login credentials safe.
